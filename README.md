# Code Fights Solutions

Attempting to complete some of the problems on [Code Fights](https://www.codefights.com), I will be doing these in both Python, Go and Rust.

As I am trying to "master" Python and learn both Go and Rust, this is a good exercise even if it is somewhat more difficult to complete them using Rust.

I am interested in learning Go and Rust as they allow for better concurrency than Python, with the advent of more cores as opposed to big single-threaded gains in CPUs I believe these kinds of languages are needed for the future.
